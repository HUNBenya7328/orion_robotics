This is my website created as a final project for one of my courses.
It represents a fictional company called Orion Robotics.

The website presents a modern robotics company with sections for products, and contact information.
It’s designed to demonstrate basic web development skills, including layout, navigation, and responsive design.

To open the website:
  1. Download or clone this repository.
  2. Extract the file.
  3. Open the file index.html in your browser.
